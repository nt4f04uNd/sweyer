# Security Policy

We take security seriously and strive to respond promptly and responsibly to all reported vulnerabilities.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've identified a potential security vulnerability, please disclose it responsibly by following one of these reporting methods:

- **(Preferred)** Use the GitHub Security Advisory ["Report a Vulnerability"](https://github.com/nt4f04uNd/sweyer/security/advisories/new) option.  
  _This ensures the entire maintainers' circle will receive and review your report promptly, allowing us to coordinate efficiently and transparently. You will also clearly see our responses and planned action regarding your disclosure._

- Alternatively, you may contact the project owner privately via email at **nt4f04und@gmail.com**.

Thank you for responsibly helping us maintain the security of this project.
